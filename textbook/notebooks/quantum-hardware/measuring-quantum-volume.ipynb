    "Comparing different quantum computers is not an easy task. There are many different factors that affect the performance of a quantum computer and it’s not always clear which factors will have the biggest effect when doing useful quantum computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you were designing your quantum computer: Would you trade higher fidelity gates (with less errors) for reduced qubit connectivity (requiring longer circuits)? Maybe you have a great [transpiler](gloss:transpiler) that can organise the swaps so reduced connectivity isn’t as much of an issue, or maybe the readout errors are so high that any improvement in gate fidelity is negligible anyway? We can add each of these statistics to our quantum computer scorecard, but the exact importance of each element is up for debate. Additionally, even if we scored highly at each individual metric, there could still be other unforeseen problems that arise when running quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing is certain, we need many qubits and the ability to manipulate them precisely in order to achieve a [quantum advantage](gloss:quantumadvantage). If we do not have enough qubits, we cannot do any useful computations, and if these qubits are not precise or reliable enough, then our measurements will be meaningless.\n"
