    "There are four different approaches for combining quantum computing and machine learning, which are differentiated by whether the data is classical _(**C**)_ or quantum _(**Q**)_ in nature, or whether the algorithm is executed on a classical _(**C**)_ or quantum _(**Q**)_ computer, as illustrated below from Reference [1](#references). In this context, a quantum dataset consists of observations from a natural or artificial quantum system, such as measurements of qubit interactions, while a classical dataset consists of observations from a classical system, such as times series, text, or images.\n",

You will learn later that it is the [variational quantum classifier](vqc.ipynb).\n",

    "- The variational circuit ($\\mathcal{W}$) transforms the output of $\\mathcal{U}_\\Phi$ into something that helps us predict the labels corresponding to $\\vec{x_i}$. We tweak this circuit according to a set of variables, $\\vec{\\theta}$, i.e. $\\mathcal{W}$ is parametrized by $\\vec{\\theta}$.\n",

    "In the training phase, we are trying to find the values for $\\vec{\\theta}$ that give us the best predictions. The classical computer compares the predicted labels, $\\hat{y_i}$, to the provided labels, $y_i$, and we calculate the success of our predictions using a [cost function](gloss:cost_function). Based on this cost, the classical computer chooses another value for $\\vec{\\theta}$ using a classical optimization algorithm. This new $\\vec{\\theta}$ is then used to run a new circuit, and the process is repeated until the cost function stabilizes.\n",
