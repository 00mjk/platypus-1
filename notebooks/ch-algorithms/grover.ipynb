    "You have likely heard that one of the many advantages a quantum computer has over a classical computer is its superior speed searching databases. Grover's algorithm demonstrates this capability. This algorithm can speed up an unstructured search problem quadratically, but its uses extend beyond that; it can serve as a general trick or subroutine to obtain quadratic run time improvements for a variety of other algorithms. This is called the amplitude amplification trick.    \n",

On a quantum computer, however, we can find the marked item in roughly $\\sqrt{N}$ steps with Grover's amplitude amplification trick. A quadratic speedup is indeed a substantial time-saver for finding marked items in long lists. Additionally, the algorithm does not use the list's internal structure, which makes it *generic;* this is why it immediately provides a quadratic quantum speed-up for many classical problems.\n"

    "### Algorithm Overview <a id='overview'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm consists of three main algorithms steps: state preparation, the oracle, and the diffusion operator. The state preparation is where we create the search space, which is all possible cases the answer could take. In the list example we mentioned above, the search space would be all the items of that list.    \n",
    "The oracle is what marks the correct answer, or answers we are looking for, and the diffusion operator magnifies these answers so they can stand out and be measured at the end of the algorithm.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Maybe create a similar graphics for the book**\n",
    "\n",
    "![image2](images/grover_steps.png)    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the algorithm work? Before looking at the list of items, we have no idea where the marked item is. Therefore, any guess of its location is as good as any other, which can be expressed in terms of a\n",
    "uniform superposition: $|s \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{x = 0}^{N -1} | x\n",
    "\\rangle.$\n",
    "\n",
    "If at this point we were to measure in the standard basis $ \\{ | x \\rangle \\} $, this superposition would collapse, according to the fifth quantum law, to any one of the basis states with the same probability of $\\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{1}{2^n}$. Our chances of guessing the right value $w$ is therefore $1$ in $2^n$, as could be expected. Hence, on average we would need to try about $N/2 = 2^{n-1}$ times to guess the correct item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the procedure called amplitude amplification, which is how a quantum computer significantly enhances this probability. This procedure stretches out (amplifies) the amplitude of the marked item, which shrinks the other items' amplitude, so that measuring the final state will return the right item with near-certainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm has a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of two reflections, which generate a rotation in a two-dimensional plane. The only two special states we need to consider are the winner $| w \\rangle$ and the uniform superposition $| s \\rangle$. These two vectors span a two-dimensional plane in the vector space $\\mathbb{C}^N.$ They are not quite perpendicular because $| w \\rangle$ occurs in the superposition with amplitude $N^{-1/2}$ as well.\n",
    "We can, however, introduce an additional state $|s'\\rangle$ that is in the span of these two vectors, which is perpendicular to $| w \\rangle$ and is obtained from $|s \\rangle$ by removing $| w \\rangle$ and\n",
    "rescaling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: The amplitude amplification procedure starts out in the uniform superposition $| s \\rangle$, which is easily constructed from $| s \\rangle = H^{\\otimes n} | 0 \\rangle^n$ or using another symmetric entangled states.\n",

    "![image3](images/grover_step1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The left graphic corresponds to the two-dimensional plane spanned by perpendicular vectors $|w\\rangle$ and $|s'\\rangle$ which allows to express the initial state as $|s\\rangle = \\sin \\theta | w \\rangle + \\cos \\theta | s' \\rangle,$ where $\\theta = \\arcsin \\langle s | w \\rangle = \\arcsin \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$. The right graphic is a bar graph of the amplitudes of the state $| s \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: We apply the oracle reflection $U_f$ to the state $|s\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image4](images/grover_step2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically this corresponds to a reflection of the state $|s\\rangle$ about $|s'\\rangle$. This transformation means that the amplitude in front of the $|w\\rangle$ state becomes negative, which in turn means that the average amplitude (indicated by a dashed line) has been lowered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: We now apply an additional reflection ($U_s$) about the state $|s\\rangle$: $U_s = 2|s\\rangle\\langle s| - \\mathbb{1}$. This transformation maps the state to $U_s U_f| s \\rangle$ and completes the transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image5](images/grover_step3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two reflections always correspond to a rotation. The transformation $U_s U_f$ rotates the initial state $|s\\rangle$ closer towards the winner $|w\\rangle$. The action of the reflection $U_s$ in the amplitude bar diagram can be understood as a reflection about the average amplitude. Since the average amplitude has been lowered by the first reflection, this transformation boosts the negative amplitude of $|w\\rangle$ to roughly three times its original value, while it decreases the other amplitudes. We then go to **step 2** to repeat the application. This procedure will be repeated several times to zero in on the winner. \n",
    "\n",
    "After $t$ steps we will be in the state $|\\psi_t\\rangle$ where: $| \\psi_t \\rangle = (U_s U_f)^t  | s \\rangle.$\n",
    "\n",
    "How many times do we need to apply the rotation? It turns out that roughly $\\sqrt{N}$ rotations suffice. This becomes clear when looking at the amplitudes of the state $| \\psi \\rangle$. We can see that the amplitude of $| w \\rangle$ grows linearly with the number of applications $\\sim t N^{-1/2}$. However, since we are dealing with amplitudes and not probabilities, the vector space's dimension enters as a square root. Therefore it is the amplitude, and not just the probability, that is being amplified in this procedure.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step of Grover's algorithm is the initial state preparation. As we just mentioned, the search space is all possible values we need to search through to find the answer we want. For the examples in this textbook, our 'database' is comprised of all the possible computational basis states our qubits can be in. For example, if we have 3 qubits, our list is the states $|000\\rangle, |001\\rangle, \\dots |111\\rangle$ (i.e the states $|0\\rangle \\rightarrow |7\\rangle$). So, in this case the size of our search space will be $N = 2^{3} = 8$.\n",

    "**Maybe add a page about the Dicke state in the composer circuit examples??**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, if we know the range within the search space where the answer is guaranteed to be, we can eliminate the redundant basis out of our search space to speed up the algorithm and decrease the size of the circuit. Generally speaking, we can prepare our state using any [symmetric states](gloss:ss), such as [GHZ-states](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/example-circuits/ghz), [W-states](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/example-circuits/w-state), or [Dicke-states](gloss:ds). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are trying to solve a problem with one answer using 4 qubits, and we prepare our state using the Hadamard gate (i.e. forming the Hilbert Space), N will be 16. But, if we know that the answer is within states when only one qubit has the value of 1 at any time, we can then use the W-state instead of the full Hilbert space to prepare our states. Doing that, decreased the size of the search space from 16 to 4 and the number of optimal iterations $t$ from 3 to 1."

To do that we will need 4-qubits, each qubit represents a node in the graph. The state of the qubit will indicate whether the node in any subgraph or not. For example, in the graph above, the triangle is between nodes 0,1, and 2, we can rephrase that using the state `1110`. The nodes with state 1 are in the subgraph (triangle) and the node with state 0 is not.   \n",
