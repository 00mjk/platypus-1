    "It is important to know that when running a circuit on a real quantum computer, cicruits typically need to be transpiled for the backend that you select so that the circuit contains only those gates that the quantum computer can actually perform. Primarily this involves the addition of swap gates so that two-qubit gates in the circuit map to those pairs of qubits on the device that can actually perform these gates. The following cell shows the AND gate represented as a Toffoli gate decomposed into single- and two-qubit gates, which are the only types of gate that can be run on IBM hardware.  Provided that CNOT gates can be performed between all three qubits, a triangle topology, no other gates are required."
