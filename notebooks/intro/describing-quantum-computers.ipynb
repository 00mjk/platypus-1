    "# Describing quantum computers\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will introduce the different mathematical objects and notations that we’re going to be using to describe quantum computers. Symbols, equations and specialist vocabulary allow us to communicate and work with maths in a very concise way, they’re incredibly powerful tools, but they also come at a cost; they are difficult to understand if you don’t know what all the symbols mean, and this can alienate people. To counter this, in this textbook, equations are interactive. You can move your mouse over symbols to see what they mean. We will also slowly sprinkle in some esoteric words so you can start speaking the language of mathematics and quantum computing, and you can see explanations of these words by moving your mouse over these words too.\n",

    "## Amplitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical probability is often represented by a real number between 0 and 1, amplitudes also have a direction. A natural candidate to represent an amplitude is a complex number, as a complex number can also be completely described by both a magnitude and a direction, but in this course we will only work with amplitudes that can point in two directions (e.g. left and right) and we won’t worry about anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image comparing amplitudes and probabilities](images/quantum-states/prob-vs-amp.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the maths a lot simpler, as we can now describe any amplitude as a number between -1 and +1; if the number is positive, the amplitude is facing forward, and if it's negative, it's facing backwards. It turns out that this is still enough to do interesting things!\n",

    "## Adding and multiplying vectors\n",

    "If you study other areas of mathematics, you’ll find that lots of things can be considered vectors. We’ve introduced vectors as ‘lists of numbers’, because this is how we will consider them both in this textbook and in Qiskit. But what separates a vector from any old list of numbers is that mathematicians decided on some well defined rules for adding two vectors, and for multiplying vectors by scalars.\n",

    "In the same way that not every vector is a valid statevector, not every matrix is a valid quantum operation. If a matrix is to make sense as a real operation, it needs to keep the total probability of the output states equal to 1. So for example, this couldn’t be a real operation:\n",

    "and the total probabilities add to two, which doesn't make any sense. Alternatively, if it acted on the state $|1\\rangle$, then the total probabilities would add up to zero, which also doesn't make sense. To preserve the total probability in all cases, our operations need to be reversible. This means we can perform our quantum gates backwards to 'undo' them (remembering to reverse any rotations) and be left with the state we started with. We say matrices with this property are _unitary_. You will often see quantum gates referred to as 'unitaries' or 'unitary gates'."
