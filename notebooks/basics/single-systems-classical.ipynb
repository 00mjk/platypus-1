    "## Classical information\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe quantum information and how it works, it is helpful to begin with a mathematical description of *classical* information.\n",
    "This is so for multiple reasons.\n",
    "One reason is that, although quantum and classical information are different in some pretty spectacular ways, their mathematical descriptions are actually quite similar in how they work.\n",
    "A second reason is that classical information serves as a familiar point of reference when studying quantum information, as well as a source of analogy that goes a surprisingly long way.\n",
    "Indeed, it is quite common that questions that arise when one is learning about quantum information and computation have natural classical analogs — and the sometimes obvious answers to the classical analogs of these questions can provide both clarity and insight into the original question."

    "More specifically,  we will assume that this system can be in one of a finite number of *classical states* at each instant.\n",
    "Here, the term *classical state* should be understood in intuitive terms, as a configuration that can be recognized and described unambiguously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The archetypal example, which we will come back to repeatedly, is that of a *bit*, which is a system whose classical states are 0 and 1.\n",
    "Other examples include a standard six-sided die, whose classical states are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; a nucleobase in a strand of DNA, whose classical states are *A*, *C*, *G*, and *T*; and a switch on an electric fan, whose classical states are (commonly) *high*, *medium*, *low*, and *off*.\n",
    "In mathematical terms, the specification of the classical states of a system are, in fact, the starting point: we *define* a bit to be a system that has classical states 0 and 1, and likewise for systems having different classical state sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of the discussion that follows, let us give the name $\\mathsf{X}$ to the system being considered, and let us use the symbol $\\Sigma$ to refer to the set of classical states of $\\mathsf{X}$.\n",
    "In addition to the assumption that $\\Sigma$ is *finite*, as was already mentioned, we naturally assume that $\\Sigma$ is *nonempty*, as it is nonsensical for a physical system to have no states at all that it can be in.\n",
    "Although it is sensible to consider physical systems having infinitely many classical states, we will not be concerned with this possibility at this time.\n",
    "For the sake of convenience and brevity, the term *classical state set* should hereafter be understood to mean *a finite and nonempty set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $\\mathsf{X}$ is a bit, then $\\Sigma = {\\{0,1\\}}$;\n",
    "if $\\mathsf{X}$ is a six-sided die, then $\\Sigma = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$; and if $\\mathsf{X}$ is an electric fan switch, then \n",
    "$\\Sigma = \\{\\mathrm{high},\\mathrm{medium},\\mathrm{low},\\mathrm{off}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about $\\mathsf{X}$ as a carrier of information, where the different classical states of $\\mathsf{X}$ may have different interpretations and may lead to different outcomes or consequences, it may be sufficient to describe $\\mathsf{X}$ as simply being in one of its possible classical states.\n",
    "For instance, if $\\mathsf{X}$ is a fan switch, we might happen to know with certainty that it is set to *high*.\n",
    "It is very common in the context of information processing, however, that our knowledge of $\\mathsf{X}$ is *uncertain*, and we represent our knowledge of the classical state of $\\mathsf{X}$ by assigning *probabilities* to each classical state, resulting in a *probabilistic state*.\n",

    "In addition to its succinctness, the identification of a probabilistic state with a column vector has the advantage that operations on probabilistic states are represented through matrix–vector multiplication, as the reader may well be aware, and as will be discussed in greater detail shortly.\n",

    "The state of our coin after we flip it, but before we look, is either heads or tails and we simply do not know which until we look — and doing so does not actually change the state of the coin, but only our knowledge of it.\n",
    "Upon seeing that the classical state of the coin is tails, say, we naturally update our knowledge by assigning the probabilistic state $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$ to the coin — but to someone else in the room who was not able to see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state of the coin would remain unchanged and would be described by the probability vector specified previously.\n",
