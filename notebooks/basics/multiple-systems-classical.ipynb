    "### Classical state sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with *classical state sets* of multiple systems.\n",
    "For simplicity and clarity we will begin by discussing just two systems, and then generalize this discussion to more than two systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, let us suppose that $\\mathsf{X}$ is a system having classical state set $\\Sigma$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ is a second system having classical state set $\\Gamma$.\n",
    "As in the previous lesson, because we have referred to these sets as *classical state sets*, we assume that $\\Sigma$ and $\\Gamma$ are finite and nonempty sets.\n",
    "It could be that $\\Sigma = \\Gamma$, but this is not required — and, in any case, it will be convenient for the discussion that follows to use different names to refer to these sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that these two systems are placed side-by-side, with $\\mathsf{X}$ on the left and $\\mathsf{Y}$ on the right, and viewed together as if they form a single system, which will be denoted by $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$.\n",
    "(The notation $\\mathsf{XY}$ may also be used if it is more convenient.)\n",
    "One may then ask: What is the classical state set of this single, joint system $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that the classical state set of $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ is the *Cartesian product* of $\\Sigma$ and $\\Gamma$, which is the set defined as\n",

    "and if the classical state of $\\mathsf{X}$ is $a\\in\\Sigma$ and the classical state of $\\mathsf{Y}$ is $b\\in\\Gamma$, then the state of the pair $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ is $(a,b)$.\n",
    "That is, the Cartesian product is precisely the mathematical notion that captures the situation at hand.\n",

    "Indeed, in theoretical computer science, the notion of a string is formalized in mathematical terms through Cartesian products.\n",
    "In that context, it is typical that the term *alphabet* is used rather than classical state set, but the definition (i.e., a finite and nonempty set) is precisely the same.\n",
