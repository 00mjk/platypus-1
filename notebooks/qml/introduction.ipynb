Throwing in quantum computing gives rise to interesting areas of research that aim to use the principles of quantum mechanics to augment machine learning or vice-versa. In this chapter, we aim to give you a glimpse into the exciting and rapidly changing field of near-term quantum machine learning."

[qPCA](https://doi.org/10.1038/nphys3029), [qSVM](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.130503) and [qClustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0411), boast exponental speedups compared to their classical algorithms, however there are currently no viable hardware candidates for realizing qRAM. \n",

Perhaps the existence of quantum hardware will further enable advances in the field?\n",
